  Project: Sum computation (question #2)
  Purpose: Find the sum of all integers between two given integers.
  Due date: September 25th, 2020
  */
/*
 I used edge cases to test the limitations of my program. For example, I tested what the program
 outputted when I entered the same value to see if the first number had to be strictly less than
 the second. The program did not output the correct result, so I knew the first number did have
 to be strictly less than the second. I also tested if I could input decimals. This did not work
 as I defined the first and second numbers as integers. Therefore, the program works for any two
 integers such that the second integer is strictly greater than the first and both numbers are
 between -2147483648 to 214748364.
 
Outputs for step (1):
 1-500 (inclusive)-> 125250
 5-2141200 (inclusive)->2041200
 42-32000 (inclusive)->512015139

    double n = (b - a) + 1; // used double since n will be divided by 2 and we want decimals

    int sum = (n / 2) * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d); // formula from assignment sheet
